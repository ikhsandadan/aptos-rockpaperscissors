In this project, I have added several features including a frontend and other functionalities which I will explain page by page.


## 1. Home

On this page, I created the initial interface as shown in the image below:

-   Users can choose an icon for the hand they want to use. There are free hand icons and those that the user has purchased.

-   After selecting a hand icon, users can start the game by choosing between rock, paper, or scissors.

-   I also added a win streak feature to track consecutive user wins, which will be saved on the leaderboard.

## 2. Store

On the Store page, I created several hand icons in the form of NFTs that users can purchase with Aptos Tokens.

On the Leaderboard page, I created a leaderboard listing users with the highest win streaks.
